    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",

    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",

    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",

    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "# Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    " this algorithm offers plenty of advantages to its users. That’s why it has a lot of applications in various sectors too. Here are some applications of Naive Bayes algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "As this algorithm is fast and efficient, you can use it to make real-time predictions.\n",
    "This algorithm is popular for multi-class predictions. You can find the probability of multiple target classes easily by using this algorithm.\n",
    "Email services (like Gmail) use this algorithm to figure out whether an email is a spam or not. This algorithm is excellent for spam filtering.\n",
    "Its assumption of feature independence, and its effectiveness in solving multi-class problems, makes it perfect for performing Sentiment Analysis. Sentiment Analysis refers to the identification of positive or negative sentiments of a target group (customers, audience, etc.)\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering and the Naive Bayes algorithm work together to build recommendation systems. These systems use data mining and machine learning to predict if the user would like a particular resource or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "### strengths \n",
    "This algorithm works very fast and can easily predict the class of a test dataset. \n",
    "You can use it to solve multi-class prediction problems as it’s quite useful with them. \n",
    " Naive Bayes classifier performs better than other models with less training data if the assumption of independence of features holds. \n",
    "If you have categorical input variables, the Naive Bayes algorithm performs exceptionally well in comparison to numerical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### weaknesses\n",
    "If your test data set has a categorical variable of a category that wasn’t present in the training data set, the Naive Bayes model will assign it zero probability and won’t be able to make any predictions in this regard. This phenomenon is called ‘Zero Frequency,’ and you’ll have to use a smoothing technique to solve this problem.\n",
    "This algorithm is also notorious as a lousy estimator. So, you shouldn’t take the probability outputs of ‘predict_proba’ too seriously. \n",
    "It assumes that all the features are independent. While it might sound great in theory, in real life, you’ll hardly find a set of independent features. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasons for choosing\n",
    "\n",
    "In our situation, there are several categorical features that a naive Bayes model can handle well. A Gaussian Naive Bayes model requires a normally distributed dataset in addition to the other requirements. Because it operates in linear time, the naive Bayes model can work efficiently with our dataset training size of 36177 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "# AdaBoost \n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost may be used to tackle a range of real-world problems, such as predicting customer churn and categorising the types of topics customers are talking about or calling about. The technique is often used to solve classification issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### strengths \n",
    "\n",
    "For cascading, you make excellent use of weak classifiers.\n",
    "As weak classifiers, various classification algorithms can be utilised;\n",
    "AdaBoost offers a high level of accuracy.\n",
    "AdaBoost fully considers the weight of each classifier, unlike the bagging algorithm and the Random ForestAlgorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation can be used to identify the number of AdaBoost iterations, which is also a poorly set number of weak classifiers.\n",
    "Classification accuracy suffers as a result of data imbalance.\n",
    "Training takes time, so it's preferable to take a break after each reselection of the current classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasons for choosing\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our problem dataset is so well-organized, our ensemble method is a good fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "A business wants to know whether word count and country of origin impact the probability that an email is spam. To understand the relationship between these two predictor variables and the probability of an email being spam, researchers can perform logistic regression.\n",
    "Researchers want to know how GPA, ACT score, and number of AP classes taken impact the probability of getting accepted into a particular university. To understand the relationship between the predictor variables and the probability of getting accepted, researchers can perform logistic regression.\n",
    "Medical researchers want to know how exercise and weight impact the probability of having a heart attack. To understand the relationship between the predictor variables and the probability of having a heart attack, researchers can perform logistic regression.\n",
    "### strengths \n",
    "Logistic regression is easier to implement, interpret, and very efficient to train.\n",
    "It makes no assumptions about distributions of classes in feature space.\n",
    "It can easily extend to multiple classes(multinomial regression) and a natural probabilistic view of class predictions.\n",
    "Good accuracy for many simple data sets and it performs well when the dataset is linearly separable.\n",
    "### weaknesses\n",
    "If the number of observations is lesser than the number of features, Logistic Regression should not be used, otherwise, it may lead to overfitting.\n",
    "It constructs linear boundaries.\n",
    "The major limitation of Logistic Regression is the assumption of linearity between the dependent variable and the independent variables.\n",
    "Logistic Regression requires average or no multicollinearity between independent variables.\n",
    "### Reasons for choosing\n",
    "Predicting a categorey (works with classification)\n",
    "Sample size is less than 100k.\n",
    "Works well with large feature sets \n",

    "After evaluating three distinct models, AdaBoost was chosen as the final model. AdaBoost, which stands for Adaptive Boosting, is a machine learning algorithm developed by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire. AdaBoost is used to build classifiers, and the algorithm works by taking a set of data and attempting to categorise and predict which elements belong to which class. AdaBoost is a strong/Boost learner that combines several weak algorithms to create a single stroner learning algorithm with higher accuracy than weak learners. AdaBoost is a quick learning algorithm that works with big data sets and may be used with any learning technique.\n",

AdaBoost is 85 percent accurate when comparing predicted answers to correct answers!is appropriate.\n",

    "I think education-num, being a numerical feature, would probably be more preferred and that's why it was chosen over the education level. Regarding capital loss, I did not include it because I thought that capital gain would be very useful to determine if an individual's income was >50k. But, now when I think about it, the capital loss will help us tremendously because the higher capital loss means the per capita income is probably less than 50k and vice versa. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The reduced data F-score accuracy is 0.8391, which is lower than the full data F-score accuracy of 0.8640.This suggests that lowering the feature set can have a negative impact on the model's performance. We can create better predictions with more features, but we'll need more data to do so.\n",
